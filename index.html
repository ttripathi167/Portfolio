				<p>This project focuses on addressing some of the challenges faced by the fictitious company North Winds, including issues such as disorganized data, customer churn, and low average ticket.</p>
				<p>To help solve these problems, I employed various Data Science techniques, such as optimizing the database organization, performing churn analysis, conducting cohort and RFM analyses, clustering customers based on their purchasing behavior, implementing a recommendation system, and introducing an Elastic Price strategy. </p>
				<p>Through the use of these techniques, we were able to provide valuable insights and solutions for North Winds, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and improve their overall profitability.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/ttripathi167/Portfolio/tree/main/rossmann_sales_forecasting-master" class="image fit"><img src="images/rossmann.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project focuses on predicting the sales forecast for the next 6 weeks of the Rossmann pharmacy chain, using Machine Learning models. The models were trained on historical sales data, and the results are delivered through a Telegram chatbot.</p>
									<p>Five different models were implemented, and the XGBoost model was selected as the most accurate. To deploy the model into production, Flask and Heroku's cloud were utilized, and the Telegram chatbot was created for users to access the predictions from anywhere.</p>
									<p>Overall, this project showcases the potential of Machine Learning in forecasting sales and highlights the benefits of using a chatbot to deliver the results conveniently.</p>
